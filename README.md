Image Searcher
This project is a simple image search engine that uses the Unsplash API. It's a great way to practice working with APIs and JavaScript.

Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to practice and improve my skills in working with APIs, JavaScript, and front-end development. APIs are a crucial part of web development and understanding how to use them is an important skill for any developer. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in making API requests and handling responses.

Usage
